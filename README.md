### Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for Data cleaning and analysis  [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-ng/)
- Structured Query Language(SQL) for quering of the Data
- Microsoft PowerBI for visualization
- Github for portfolio building

### Scope
The project focuses on analyzing a dataset containing transaction records, including details like product names, categories, sales quantities, prices, regions, and sales dates. The key areas of analysis include:

1. Sales Overview:
- Calculation of total sales and revenue across the entire dataset.
- Identification of sales trends over time, including monthly and yearly sales growth.

2. Top-Performing Products:

- Identification of high-performing regions and potential areas for improvement.

### Methodology:
1. Data Cleaning and Preparation:
- Removal of duplicates 
- Creation of derived fields like TotalSales, Month, and Year for enhanced analysis.
  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Use of pivot tables, charts, and summary statistics to explore the dataset.
- Identification of key metrics such as total sales, average sales per product, and revenue by region.
  
3. Visualization:
- Development of interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize sales performance.
- Use of charts such as line charts, bar charts, and pie charts to communicate insights effectively.
  
4. Advanced Analysis:
